## Labs

Due dates are set in gradescope.  Look for them there.

**Note** The links below are disabled until the lab is released (typically around class time).

**Note** The importing process in GitHub Classroom can take a surprisingly long time.  Be patient.

## Pulling Updates

Occasionally, we find bugs in the starter repo and push updates to it.  To get them you need to 'fetch from upstream' using git.  The first time you do this you need to do:

```git remote add upstream <starter repo>```

Where `starter repo` is the url as your repo but with your username replaced with `starter`.  

For example, for lab 1 (introduction to the development environment), instead of 

```
https://github.com/CSE141pp/wi20-CSE141L-intro-stevenjswanson.git
```

It would be 

```
https://github.com/CSE141pp/wi20-CSE141L-intro-starter.git
```

Note that for other labs, you should replace `intro` with the lab name and `starter` with your username

Then, each time I push a new update (and announce it on Piazza) you should do this:

```
git fetch upstream
```

To pull the changes.  Then you can do:

```
git diff upstream/master
```

To see what's changed.

And finally,

```
git merge remotes/upstream/master
git push
```

To merge the changes into your repo and push the results back to your repo on github.
